Python uses operating system-specific interpreters to execute code.

Data is categorized into different types.

### Booleans
* data type bool

### integers whole numbers

### floating point (decimals) 
* data type: float

### strings
* data type: str
* arithmatic expression in quotes is a string

##  Storing data using variables

Example: Hangman
Game over when-
* all guesses are used up
* guess word correctly

We need to keep track of how many guesses are remaining.
Use a variable, can access and change value when you want.
Name should indicate what the variable contains. eg email contains an email address.
* create variable at beginning
* call it guesses with a value of 10
* guesses will need to be updated throughout game
* value will decrease by 1 each guess
  
```python
guesses = 10
print(guesses)

# 10
```

```python
guesses -= 1
print(guesses)

# 9
```

```python
guesses -= 1
print(guesses)

# 8
```
